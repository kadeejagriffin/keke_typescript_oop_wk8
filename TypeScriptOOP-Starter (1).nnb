                "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the organization and manipulation of data as objects, rather than simply processing logic or functions. Good OOP practices involve designing reusable and extensible code by creating classes, interfaces, and abstract classes.\n\nWhile some programming languages like Java are purely OOP, others like Typescript combine OOP principles with scripting capabilities. In OOP, a model is designed to represent a real-life entity, and then that model is used to create different but similar objects. For example, a Car can be considered a model that defines the properties and behaviors of a generic car, and a specific car like a Ford Ranger can be an instance of that model that behaves like all other cars but may have its own unique characteristics."

The Age property should belong to all ducks still, so we will keep the Duck base class to hold the age, for these examples we will assume the ducks all age exactly the same, so there will be no need to override the getters for age.\n\n<i>Interface vs Type</i>\n\nInterfaces and Types are extremely similar in TypeScript and for the most part Interfaces and Types can be used interchangeably in TypeScript.\n\nfor an in-depth discussion on the differences visit https://www.educba.com/typescript-type-vs-interface/\n\nInterfaces are created to say this class will work with anything that needs this interface.  You can think of a CD as an interface.  There are tons of different CDs with different information on them, but they can all be put into a CD player to play there contents.  The CD is an interface that works with a CD Player then different artists can use the CD interface to create there own CDs filled with their own music.\n\n\n<strong>Note </strong> Interfaces do not have method bodies (Abstract classes have method bodies)"

If needed any character should be able to change his fighting style, say if a knight losing his sword, but finds a club he should be able to change his fighting mechanism to use the club\n\n<b>Hint: </b> To complete this assignment you will need multiple classes and interfaces and an Abstract class\n\nYou can use our [Final Rubber Ducky Walkthrough](#rubber) example as a guide "
